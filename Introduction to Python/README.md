# Introduction to Python
Majority of the material here is from the [Day 1 of Image data science with Python and Napari @ EPFL Course](https://biapol.github.io/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/day1b_Python_Introduction/readme.html) by Robert Haase et al.


This is an introductory python workbook for people who are not familiar with Python to learn python, or for those who want to brush-up their Python knowledge before the workshop. This workbook consists of two parts, and each part consists of many smaller Jupyter notebooks.

If you are not sure about taking this or not, try [this Python Quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc71qHtGkoM_vLKfN3MZ8gfQIur7Zuapf17QI2b-8xomeMI3A/viewform)! If you score less than 8, you might want to go through this before the workshop.
